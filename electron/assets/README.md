# Desktop App Assets

Place your application icons here:

- `icon.png` - Main application icon (512x512 recommended)
- `icon.ico` - Windows icon file
- `icon.icns` - macOS icon file

You can generate these from a single PNG file using online converters or tools like:
- https://iconverticons.com/online/
- https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-ico
- https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-icns

The icon should represent your StaPOS brand and be clearly visible at small sizes.
